Neo4j is a graph database management system.
    It stores data in nodes and relationships rather than tables as in traditional relational databases.
    Neo4j provides a powerful query language called Cypher for graph traversal and analysis.
    It now supports vector indexing for similarity search with the vector index plugin.
    Neo4j allows embedding generation and vector search to be combined with graph operations.
    Applications can use Neo4j to connect vector search with graph context for more meaningful results.
